    "The first algorithm I wanted to imprve was the Miller-Rabin primality test, the algorithm that check if yes or not a number is prime.\n",
    "This algorithm must be very efficient in order to make the keypair generation fast, so it is very important.\n",
    "My observation is the following: the time of generation for a keypair vary a lot from one to another. (ie: one keypair: 4s and the second one: 20s). See the graph below:"
